# Virtual Painter 🎨🖐️

## Features
- **Hand Detection**: Uses **Mediapipe** to track hands.
- **Gesture Recognition**:  
  - **Index finger up** → Draw.  
  - **Index + Middle fingers up** → Selection mode (e.g., change color or clear screen).  
- **Tip Tracking**: Detects fingertip positions for smooth drawing.
- **Canvas Overlay**: Draws on a black canvas and blends it with the webcam feed.
